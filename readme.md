# LRTSF

LRTSF (Light Rail Transit San Fernando) is a simple public transportation application that allows the user to establish a schedule of a train station and publish status updates. It is a responsive web application that can be used by both desktop and mobile technologies.

The application allows someone to enter the departure and arrival date & time of the trains, and see a list of train stations, times and durations. It also gives real-time status updates on trains, and a feature for information management of train stations and their schedules.

> This application which was I created and personally named as LRTSF (Light Rail Transit San Fernando) was the final exam given to me by Koodi Systems at my job application for the position of Full Stack Web Developer on March 2016.
